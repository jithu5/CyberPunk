# Three.js 3D Model with Environment Lighting

This is my first Three.js project, showcasing a 3D model with environment lighting to create a realistic experience. The project demonstrates how to implement environmental lighting, which affects the 3D model dynamically based on the surrounding light setup.

## Features

- **3D Model Rendering:** A detailed 3D model displayed in the scene.
- **Environment Lighting:** Realistic lighting that simulates natural light from the surrounding environment, enhancing shadows, reflections, and overall depth.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js:** For rendering the 3D model and applying environment lighting.
- **JavaScript:** For handling Three.js functionality.
- **HTML/CSS:** For basic webpage structure and styling.
